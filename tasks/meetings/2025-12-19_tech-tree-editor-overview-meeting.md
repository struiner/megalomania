# Tech Tree Editor Overview - Design Meeting Brief

**Meeting Purpose:** Establish shared understanding of the tech tree editor's current state and design principles for Phase 3 enhancements

**Attendees Required:**
- UX Designer (Primary)
- Game Designer (Primary)
- Frontend Developer (Technical)
- Accessibility Specialist (Consultation)
- Project Manager (Facilitator)

## Current Editor State Overview

### Layout Structure
The tech tree editor currently consists of:
- **Header Section:** Tree identification, version, source metadata
- **Main Grid Area:** Tier-banded node layout with drag-and-drop functionality
- **Node Detail Panel:** Form-based editing of selected nodes
- **Prerequisites Display:** Connection overlay showing node dependencies
- **Action Dock:** Import/export, preview, and tier management controls
- **Validation Panel:** Error reporting and validation issues

### Current Interaction Patterns
- Drag-and-drop node positioning within tiers
- Click-to-select node editing
- Grid-based tier management (add/remove tiers)
- Culture tag assignment and management
- Icon selection from categorized registry

## Discussion Topics

### 1. Overall Design Philosophy
- How should the editor balance power-user efficiency vs. newcomer accessibility?
- What is the target complexity level for the intended user base?
- Should we prioritize speed of editing or precision of design?

### 2. Visual Hierarchy & Information Density
- Is the current grid layout optimal for the intended tech tree complexity?
- How should we balance information density with readability?
- What visual cues are most important for user orientation?

### 3. Workflow Optimization
- What are the most common user workflows that should be optimized?
- Should we implement shortcuts for power users?
- How can we reduce cognitive load during complex editing sessions?

## Design Decisions Needed
