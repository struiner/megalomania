## Design Questions & Discussions

### 1. Icon Discovery
- How can users quickly find the right icon for their technology?
- Should icons be searchable by name, category, or visual similarity?
- Can we provide icon suggestions based on technology properties?

### 2. Visual Hierarchy
- How should different icon categories be visually distinguished?
- Should some icon categories be more prominent than others?
- How can we balance icon variety with visual consistency?

### 3. Selection Experience

- Should users be able to upload custom icons?
- How do we maintain icon consistency across the tree?

## Critical Design Challenges

### 1. Icon Volume & Scalability
- As icon library grows, selection becomes overwhelming
- Need effective categorization and search for large icon sets
- Should implement visual similarity matching

### 2. Visual Consistency
- Icons should maintain consistent style and quality
- Need clear visual language for different icon categories
- Icons must be recognizable at small sizes

### 3. Performance Considerations
- Large icon libraries can impact loading performance
- Need efficient thumbnail generation and caching
- Should implement progressive loading for icon categories

## Accessibility Considerations

### Icon Accessibility
- Alternative text descriptions for all icons
- Keyboard navigation through icon grid
- Screen reader compatibility for icon selection
- Clear visual focus indicators

### Visual Accessibility
- Sufficient color contrast for icon visibility
- Icons must be recognizable in high contrast mode
- Scalable icon interface elements
- Alternative icon representations for colorblind users

## Design Decisions Needed
