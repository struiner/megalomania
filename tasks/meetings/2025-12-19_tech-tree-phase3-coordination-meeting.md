### 2. Data Flow Coordination
- **Real-time Updates:** Ensure changes in one element update relevant others
- **State Management:** Coordinated state across all editor components
- **Performance Impact:** Balance real-time updates with performance
- **Error Propagation:** Ensure errors in one area don't break others

## Performance Coordination

### 1. Rendering Optimization
- **Virtual Scrolling:** Coordinate virtual scrolling across grid and lists
- **Lazy Loading:** Implement consistent lazy loading patterns
- **Connection Rendering:** Optimize prerequisite overlay performance
- **Modal Performance:** Ensure modal dialogs don't impact main editor

### 2. Memory Management
- **Component Lifecycle:** Coordinate component creation and destruction
- **Event Handling:** Efficient event management across all components
- **State Caching:** Coordinate caching strategies across elements
- **Garbage Collection:** Minimize memory leaks through coordinated cleanup

## Phase 3 Enhancement Coordination

### 1. Enhancement Priorities
- **Critical Path:** Identify which enhancements block others
- **Resource Allocation:** Coordinate developer resources across tasks
- **Testing Strategy:** Coordinate testing across enhanced components
- **Documentation Updates:** Ensure documentation covers all enhancements

### 2. Quality Assurance
- **Cross-Component Testing:** Test interactions between enhanced elements
- **Performance Benchmarking:** Establish performance baselines across components
- **Accessibility Testing:** Coordinated accessibility testing across all elements
- **User Testing:** Plan user testing sessions for integrated experience

## Design Decision Framework

### 1. Decision Making Process
- **Escalation Path:** Clear path for design decisions that affect multiple elements
- **Stakeholder Input:** Coordinated input from all relevant stakeholders
- **Impact Assessment:** Evaluate impact of decisions across all components
- **Documentation:** Document decisions and rationale for future reference

### 2. Change Management
- **Change Review:** Process for reviewing changes that affect multiple elements
- **Backward Compatibility:** Ensure changes don't break existing workflows
- **Migration Planning:** Plan for any required user migrations
- **Rollback Strategy:** Prepare rollback plans for problematic changes

## Success Metrics

### 1. User Experience
- **Task Completion:** Users can complete editing tasks efficiently
- **Error Reduction:** Reduced errors through better design coordination
- **Learning Curve:** Easier onboarding for new users
- **Satisfaction:** Improved user satisfaction with integrated experience

### 2. Technical Excellence
