- **Wave 2 Dependencies:** Components can execute in parallel after Wave 1 completion
- **Wave 3 Dependencies:** Integration tasks depend on all Wave 2 task completion
- **Wave 4 Dependencies:** Validation depends on all previous wave completion

### Scope Discipline
All tasks maintain explicit non-goals and avoid scope creep by:
- Clearly defining what's in scope vs. out of scope per wave
- Preventing cross-domain logic mixing
- Maintaining architectural boundaries
- Focusing on single, composable concerns
- Following established charter compliance from `megalomania/agents.md`

## Quality Assurance

### Review Gates
Each task includes specific review gate questions to ensure:
- Charter compliance verification
- UX effectiveness validation
- Technical implementation quality
- Accessibility requirement fulfillment

### Success Criteria
All tasks include measurable acceptance criteria that can be objectively verified during completion.

## Next Steps

### Immediate Actions (Week 1)
1. **Project Manager Review:** Validate wave structure and priority assignments
2. **Architecture Steward Review:** Ensure charter compliance and critical path integrity
3. **Resource Allocation:** Confirm Frontend Developer availability for Wave 1 (100% allocation)

### Execution Planning (Week 1-2)
4. **Wave 1 Kickoff:** Begin design system foundation tasks (P0-1 through P0-4)
5. **Parallel Preparation:** Prepare Wave 2 component specifications for parallel execution
6. **Dependency Tracking:** Establish monitoring for critical path progression

### Ongoing Monitoring (Throughout Execution)
7. **Weekly Progress Reviews:** Track wave completion against 10-week timeline
8. **Parallel Execution Coordination:** Manage Canvas, Detail Panel, and Preview development
9. **Integration Testing:** Begin integration testing as soon as Wave 2 components are available
10. **Final Validation:** Ensure WCAG 2.1 AA compliance before project completion

### Risk Mitigation Priorities
- **Design System Completion:** Allocate senior resources, establish clear acceptance criteria
- **Performance Virtualization:** Implement early prototyping, establish performance budgets  
- **Cross-Component Integration:** Incremental integration testing, define clear interfaces
