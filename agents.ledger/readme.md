# agents.ledger

This directory is the append-only memory ledger for agents.

- It records **decisions, outcomes, and precedents**
- It does **not** define rules
- It does **not** grant authority

AGENTS.md is the highest authority.

Binary indexes in `/index` are derived and may be deleted at any time.

When in doubt:
- Record the uncertainty
- Escalate
- Do not invent doctrine
